# QuadTorp Intrusion Dection System is designed #
#  to effectively map and log all LAN activity  #
#    while also verbosing and documenting       #
#   vulnerabilities within certain devices      #

:: **--ttl** :: *Connection timeout.*

:: **--hd** :: *Hides donation information.*

:: **-r** :: --rate :: *Minutes between scans.*

:: **-s** :: --smooth :: *Smoothly print scans.*

:: *-m* :: --maxthread :: Limits how many active
threads can be made. More threads means more CPU
usage and battery consumption! Min: 20 Max: 400

:: *-a* :: --auto-clear :: Clear terminal after x
amount of scans have been made. This will reduce
lag and memory buildup (especially for long-term
scans).

:: *-l* :: --level :: Select scanning intensity
	level while searching for devices.

..::SECURITY: Find vulnerable devices and report
              any new devices on the network.
..::PASSIVE : Scan basic devices and log info.
..::DEFCON  : Report vulnerable devices and
              actively check for network ports.

:: *-n* :: --network-level :: Scanning Range.

..::DYNAMIC : Scans all subnet ranges and reports
              all active subnets for future scans
..::LOCAL   : Scans all addresses on the same
              level as the host scanning.
..::MAX     : Scans all addresses.

# 1. Try to avoid stopping the program while a
# scan is actively running. This may lead to
# large scale crashes, so instead stop the
# program when it is either printing statistics
# or when it is waiting to initialize the next scan.

# 2. To set up custom subnet scan ranges, go to
# ./networks/<net>/stat.dyn (or make stat.dyn)
# and make a Python list containing the first 3
# positions of the address followed by %s. When
# set in dynamic mode, QuadTorp will use this
# to know where to scan! If you don't know your
# active address range, run QuadTorp in max mode.
# Example of stat.dyn:
	["192.168.1.%s","192.168.2.%s","192.168.3.%s"]
